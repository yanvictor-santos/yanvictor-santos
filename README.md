### Hello world, i'm Yan Victor ðŸ‘‹

<p>ðŸ‘‹ A 27-year-old technology enthusiast, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development.</p>
<p>ðŸš€ Currently, I'm diving into the world of front-end development but the goal is still to be a full-stack. I've already mastered HTML and CSS, and I'm exploring the wonders of JavaScript, with exciting plans to delve into React soon.<p>
<p>ðŸ’» I like solving problems and facing challenges head on. I'm not afraid to ask questions, learn from mistakes and look for solutions. Every question is a learning opportunity!<p>
